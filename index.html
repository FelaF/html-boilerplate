    <h1>Creating without Experience</h1>
    <p> One of the main reasons that I feel the most alive is when I create <em>JUST TO CREATE</em>; without any goal.</p>

    <h2> The 3 Benefits of Creating without Experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can learn as you go</li>
        <li>Learning about your craft become more interactive</li>
        <li> Failure becomes normative, and progress become simpler</li>
